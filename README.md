# Product Foundry AI Builders Circle Collaboration Space

Please use Discussions area for all your collaboration. Create a thread for each initiative or collaboration

This is your space. Please make it your own. The growth of the community and its knowledgebase depends on you.
We learn together. Take intiative and create value. Investigate topics of interest to you and post on discussions
Once you have reached a point of conclusion please document good practices and discoveries.

Sometimes the person who knows the most and has the most interest is you. We are all unique and different. We can expect to reap what we sow.

We are moving to a fortnightly cadence to allow enough time for prepare and call for contributions for our monthly get-togethers
We will have discussions and demos at alternate meetings
